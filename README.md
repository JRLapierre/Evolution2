<h1> Evolution2 </h1>

Version 1.5

this is my second neural network project. In this project, I want to make a structure that is more optimized and open to new features than the last. <br>

I made two models of neral network (see package brain), one learning algorithm and two selection algorithm. I plan to do more.

I just do that for fun, so feel free to use this however you like.

<h2> version history </h2>

<h5> 1.5 </h5>

Implementation of multithreading in the computing process of the LayeredBrain

<h4> 1.4 </h4>

Addition of a new selection algorithm : the roulette weel selection algorithm. This algorithm uses a bit of random, but still favors the bests.

<h4> 1.3 </h4>

Addition of a system to regularely save automatically.

<h4> 1.2.1 </h4>

Usage of the brain recombinaison in the Elitism algorithm. <br>
/!\ the saves from before this update will be unusable

<h4> 1.2 </h4>

Creation of a static function in Brain (combine(Brain parent1, Brain parent2)) allowing to fuse two brains of the same type.

<h4> 1.1 </h4>
Developpement of two systems that allow to run the simulation for a set amount of time or a set amount of iterations.

<h4> 1.0 </h4>
First version of the program : <br>
Developpement of two kind of brain : FlexibleBrain and LayeredBrain. <br>
Developpement of a way to track mutations <br>
Developpement of the NEAT algorithm with one selection algorithm <br>
Developpement of a graphic window to control the simulation <br>
